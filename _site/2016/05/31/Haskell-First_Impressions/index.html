<p>I have been fortunate enough to develop enterprise applications using functional programming as part of my job. I use F# extensively to write code ranging from analytical/quantitative software to reporting frameworks and domain specific languages. F# has been a great language to learn and is a very powerful tool to have in the .NET environment. However I have always been fascinated by Haskell. Partly due to its portrayal as a pure functional language and how it forces the use of strict functional paradigms.</p>

<p>Needless to say part of my learning to-dos this year is learning Haskell and hopefully implementing it in a real world application. I have been learning it for a couple of weeks now through the Learn You a Haskell for Great Good book available freely at http://learnyouahaskell.com. Mostly on and off on weekends. This is my first tryst with haskell and Learn You A Haskell is a great introduction to the language notorious for having a steep learning curve. Also I absolutely agree with haskellers that learning haskell provides insights into functional programming that are easily missed with F# and maybe other functional programming languages out there. A reason might be that it is very easy to manipulate F# into a non functional way of doing things. With Haskell , and it might be the way in which it limits you to thinking in a certain manner, manipulations are not as straightforward.</p>

<p>Unless you are really into it , it is difficult to compare languages and I would prefer not to do so. F# has its charm and usability and if you are in a .NET environment it is the language to go for. I am a newbie as far as Haskell is concerned. However no harm in showing off an elegant solution that haskell provides for an interesting problem.</p>

<p>Enter Project Euler</p>

<p>Chances are if you are reading this post, you are well aware of Project Euler. If not, you should register at https://projecteuler.net and start hacking. Its a great resource to learn any new programming language. Needless to say I have been using it for haskell.</p>

<p>Problem 4 : The problem 4 in project euler involves working in and around strings and goes as follows</p>

<p>A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.</p>

<p>My solution as I approached this is as below.</p>
