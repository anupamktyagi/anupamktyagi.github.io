          <p>I have been fortunate enough to develop enterprise applications using functional programming as part of my job. I use F# extensively to write code ranging from analytical/quantitative software to reporting frameworks and domain specific languages. F# has been a great language to learn and is a very powerful tool to have in the .NET environment. However I have always been fascinated by Haskell. Partly due to its portrayal as a pure functional language and how it forces the use of strict functional paradigms.</p>
